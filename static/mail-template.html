    Hi {{honorific}}. {{first-name}} {{last-name}},

    <p>
      I am a junior at Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, California and
      I'm currently conducting a self-guided research project about counseling
      during COVID that is designed to gather and analyze data about COVID's
      impact on students. I'm reaching out to counselors rather than high
      schoolers themselves to get a more uniform and accurate representation of
      the academic and social impacts of COVID on high schoolers.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was wondering if you would be willing to participate in the project by
      filling out this
      <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaqHZGaKglAcPa4vSAEM-XCKSvlPoGOzFk6RPq_IFLs1Tl0Q/viewform"
        >short Google Form</a
      > with questions regarding students at {{high-school}} (it only takes 5-10
      minutes). If you want to learn more about the project, the details are
      available on <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vZQ3tGVXJhUcdFJdHIiQ8sm0Y0kpDfjm_RlMKendZRU/edit"
        >this Google Doc</a
      >. If you have any feedback about the form or design of the project, let
      me know!
    </p>

    <p>
      I appreciate any input you can provide through the Google Form, but if
      you're unable to participate, I completely understand.
    </p>

    Sincerely,<br />Yash Totale
