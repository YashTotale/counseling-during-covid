    Hi {{honorific}}. {{first-name}} {{last-name}},

    <p>
      I hope this email finds you well. My name is Yash Totale and I am a junior
      at Amador Valley High School (Pleasanton, California). I am reaching out
      with a rather strange request, but one that will be incredibly useful to
      me - I was wondering if you would be willing to fill out this
      <strong>
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaqHZGaKglAcPa4vSAEM-XCKSvlPoGOzFk6RPq_IFLs1Tl0Q/viewform"
          >short Google Form</a
        >
      </strong>
      (should hopefully only take 5-10 minutes to fill out) that is designed to
      collect information about the impact of COVID on high school students and
      their academic performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am interested in researching the impact of COVID on students, and to
      this end, I'm currently developing a research project about counseling
      during COVID that is designed to gather and analyze data about COVID's
      impact on students. I have created a
      <strong>
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vZQ3tGVXJhUcdFJdHIiQ8sm0Y0kpDfjm_RlMKendZRU/edit"
          >Google Doc</a
        ></strong
      >
      that details the different phases of this project, and the motivation
      behind it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you would like to share this form with other counselors at
      {{high-school}} who can provide input about the impact of COVID on
      students, please feel free to do so, I would greatly appreciate it! Also,
      please feel free to provide any suggestions or concerns about the form or
      the project itself. I completely understand if you are unable to
      participate. Nonetheless, I am really grateful for your time and
      consideration. I look forward to your responses (that will be used for
      research anonymously) or any suggestions and comments you may have.
    </p>

    Thank You,<br />Yash Totale
